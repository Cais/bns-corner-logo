Read this article for further assistance: http://wpfirstaid.com/2009/12/plugin-installation/

NB: This plugin will not resize your images, please make sure you use an appropriate sized image for the area you are placing it in. For the "fixed position" it is strongly recommended to use an image that is at least partially transparent for those readers with smaller screens.

Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility. Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.

2. A sample logo image in the sidebar widget area of the [Shades](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/shades/) theme.
